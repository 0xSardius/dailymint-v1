## üé™ Demo Day Script (3 minutes)

### Hook (30 seconds)
"How many of you have tried to build a creative habit and failed? Writing daily, drawing, anything? DailyMint solves this by making your creativity permanent, social, AND rewarding."

### Problem/Solution (60 seconds)
"The problem: Creative habits die because there's no accountability or reward. The solution: Every day you create something, we mint it as an NFT AND you earn DAILY tokens. Your streak becomes a permanent collection plus real value. Miss a day? Break the chain and lose your multiplier."

### Live Demo (60 seconds)
"Watch this - [open app] [quick auth with FC] Today's prompt: 'Write about something that surprised you.' [type quickly] 'I was surprised by...' [submit] [mint] Boom - that's now an NFT, plus I earned 150 DAILY tokens for my 3-day streak. [share to FC] And now it's in the social feed with my earnings."

### Traction/Vision (30 seconds)
"In 4 days of beta: 47 users, 312 creations minted, 15,000 DAILY tokens earned, 89% daily retention. This isn't just an app - it's a new creative economy. We're making creativity permanent, social, and profitable."

## üí° Hackathon Mindset Shifts

### From Enterprise ‚Üí Hackathon
- **Documentation**: Comments in code, not extensive docs
- **Testing**: Manual testing of core flow, not unit tests
- **Types**: Basic TypeScript, not perfect coverage
- **Architecture**: Simple and working, not perfect patterns
- **Features**: Core loop only, not feature-complete

### From Perfect ‚Üí Demo-Ready
- **Polish over Performance**: Better to look amazing and be slightly slow
- **Stories over Stats**: User testimonials > analytics dashboards
- **Social over Solo**: Viral features > individual optimization
- **Mobile over Desktop**: Most FC usage is mobile

### Hackathon Mantra
**"Does it work? Does it wow? Can people use it? Does it spread?"**

If yes to all four ‚Üí you win. Everything else is nice-to-have.
