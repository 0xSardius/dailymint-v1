# DailyMint - Day 1 Implementation Checklist

## üéØ Day 1 Goal

## üìã Afternoon Tasks (4 hours)

### 1. Creation Interface
- [ ] Build creation form component
- [ ] Implement textarea with character limit
- [ ] Add submission handling
- [ ] Test form validation

### 2. UI Implementation
- [ ] Set up neobrutalism.dev components
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui
- [ ] Implement neobrutalism styling
- [ ] Create responsive layout
- [ ] Test mobile compatibility

### 3. Token Reward System
- [ ] Implement coin earning logic
- [ ] Add reward calculations
- [ ] Create transaction tracking
- [ ] Test reward distribution

### 4. Deployment
- [ ] Set up Vercel project
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Test live deployment

### 5. Warpcast Integration
- [ ] Test Frame loading in Warpcast
- [ ] Verify authentication flow
- [ ] Test input acceptance
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

## üîß Required Environment Variables
```env
# Frame & Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAME_NAME=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAME_DESCRIPTION=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAME_BUTTON_TEXT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAME_PRIMARY_CATEGORY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAME_TAGS=

# Database
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Farcaster & Social
NEYNAR_API_KEY=
NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=

# Token System
COINS_V4_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

## üìù Notes
- Focus on getting the core flow working before adding extra features
- Test thoroughly on mobile devices
- Ensure all database operations are properly secured
- Keep error handling simple but effective
- Document any technical debt for future cleanup

## üéØ End of Day 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] User can sign in with Farcaster
- [ ] User can write and save content
- [ ] User can earn coins for creations
- [ ] Database handles user data securely
- [ ] Frame loads properly in Warpcast
- [ ] Basic UI is functional and responsive 

# DailyMint - Day 1 Implementation Checklist (Progress Update)

## üéØ End of Day 1 Success Criteria
- [x] User can sign in with Farcaster
- [x] User can write and save content (UI only)
- [ ] User can earn coins for creations (UI only, backend present)
- [x] Database handles user data securely
- [x] Frame loads properly in Warpcast (UI only)
- [x] Basic UI is functional and responsive

## üü° **Summary**
- **UI foundation is strong and visually complete.**
- **Backend logic and API endpoints are present.**
- **Button interactivity and end-to-end user flow need to be wired up and tested.**
- **Deployment and live testing are the next priorities.**

---

**Next Steps for Day 1 Completion:**
1. Wire up button actions to backend endpoints (mint, create, earn, share, etc.).
2. Test the full user flow in development and in Warpcast.
3. Complete deployment and verify everything works live.
